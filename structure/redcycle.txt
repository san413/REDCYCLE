🌟 1. Add Article Categories & Filters
Let users filter articles by topics like:

Menstrual Hygiene

Period Myths

Nutrition & Health

First Period Guide

Why? It enhances discoverability and keeps content organized.

🔍 2. Add Search Functionality
Let users search for articles or FAQs using keywords.

Use Django’s icontains in views:

python
Copy
Edit
Article.objects.filter(title__icontains=query)
💌 3. Add a Newsletter Signup (with Django Forms)
Capture emails for updates on new articles, blogs, or videos.

📝 4. Blog or Expert Advice Section
Let gynecologists or educators post blogs. You already have a blog app scaffolded — time to activate it!

🔒 5. Add Login/Register (for posting questions or saving articles)
Basic user accounts using Django’s built-in User model.

📱 6. Make It Mobile Responsive (Tailwind helps already)
Add breakpoints if needed for smaller screens.

✅ Recommendation:
Start with Article Categories & Filters, it’s easy and makes the site feel more structured and professional.
